# homework 4 gcp - create GCP instance with bash script to install an LAMP stack

Unfortunately, I can't get a free GCP trial account no matter what I do. I've tried creating a GCP account with many different google accounts (even registered with an EU phone number), with a VPN, with many different bank cards (UA, UK, FR) - to no avail. Previously, I had an account at the GIP, and also completed various programs, such as "Розвивайте карʼєру з Google Cloud" - [Perform Foundational Infrastructure Tasks in Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/6de7c69c-9259-49e5-bc74-104b1b450e20/badges/2774315). 
In the file [lamp.sh](https://github.com/rlnq/hw4-gcp/blob/main/lamp.sh) - Lbash script to install an LAMP stack
